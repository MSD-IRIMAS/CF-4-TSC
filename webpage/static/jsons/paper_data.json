	"abstract": "<p>In this work, we explore the creation of hand-crafted (non learned) filters in order to capture specific patterns in a time series. We propose a set of filters whose values are fixed and not modified during the training step. Our goal with these filters is to capture specific patterns in a time series (increase, decrease, peaks) and study the relevance of adding such filters to existing architectures ranging from simple architecture (Fully Convolutional Network (FNC)) to state-of-the-art architecture (InceptionTime).</p><p>Experiments reveal that adding our manually created filters increase the prediction accuracy on a majority of the 128 datasets of the UCR Archive. They also show that hand-crafted filters and learned filters are complementary to obtain the best preforming models. This work is the first step in proposing a catalog of generic and fixed filters that could be useful in a large range of applications to improve deep models accuracy for time series classification.</p>",
